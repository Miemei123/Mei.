    <br><font  face="黑体" color="red">After many years of Christmas, I met someone I like.</font><br/>
    <br><font  face="黑体" color="red">I sent him a little prince. I wrote him a letter the night before I sent it to him. </font><br/>
    <br><font  face="黑体" color="red">However, in the end, I still didn't have the courage to send it to him, and the letter was left by myself (sorry, forgive me for not throwing it away, and keep it). </font><br/>
    <br><font  face="黑体" color="red">I remember that day I ran out to buy him presents (small books and bookmarks, and a map book).</font><br/>
    <br><font  face="黑体" color="red">There is no answer. He is a good boy, but I am too clumsy. I have self-esteem and low self-esteem. </font><br/>
    <br><font  face="黑体" color="red">I can't do it without response. I want to stay in that year. </font><br/>
    <br><font  face="黑体" color="red">The little girl sitting next to him is really happy! He is quiet, gentle, clean and progressive.. </font><br/>
    <br><font  face="黑体" color="red">Please, I can't do it; please, I can't do it. Now I am also very happy, just for a happy reason,</font><br/>
    <br><font  face="黑体" color="red">I hope you are happier than me......</font><br/>
